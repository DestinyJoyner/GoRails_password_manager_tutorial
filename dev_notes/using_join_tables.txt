Many to Many Relationship Models:

- Troubleshoot:
    properly defined the many-to-many relationship in the Password model
    The dependent: :destroy ensures proper cleanup of associated records
    Find passwords through the join table
    Associate passwords with users
    Handle the many-to-many relationship properly

- Rendering on index view file:
    - render @passwords: shorthand
        - Iterates over the @passwords collection for each password, it looks for a partial named _password.html.erb in the app/views/passwords/ directory
        - need to create  partial file named _password.html.erb in app/views/passwords/ -> should expect a local variable named password
    - old iteration:
        <%# old code since using render @passwords now
        <%  @passwords.each do |password| %>
        <%= password.url %>
        <%= password.username %>
        <%= password.password %>
        <% end %>
        %>
